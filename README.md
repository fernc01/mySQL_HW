**My update quantity function doesn't work properly


This program gets information of products from the MySQL database and displays them on the screen.
The customer then selects which product they would like to purchase by typing the ID of the product.
Next, the customer types the quantity that they would like to purchase.
The program then notifies the customer that either the order was placed and it shows the total cost
or it notifies the customer that the order was canceled due to insufficient stock of the product.
